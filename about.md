Stampede is a continuous automation system similar to [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io). The system is built primarily in `node.js`, with the mobile app companion written in `Swift` and `Kotlin`. With Stampede you can setup a complete set of integrations for your code repositories, or use it as a general purpose automation platform.
